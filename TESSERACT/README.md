# Tesseract OCR

This folder contains the source code and resources for using the Tesseract OCR API, a popular open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9 or later
2. PyTorch

## Installation

1. Download and install Tesseract OCR from the official website: https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/
   - For Windows, download the `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.20231005.exe` installer.
   - After installation, make sure to add Tesseract to your system's PATH.

2. Install the `pytesseract` package using pip:

```
pip install pytesseract
```

## Usage

After installing Tesseract OCR and the `pytesseract` package, you can execute the `temp.py` file to perform OCR on your images:

```
python temp.py
```

The `temp.py` file should contain the necessary code to load images, perform OCR using the Tesseract API, and process the output.
